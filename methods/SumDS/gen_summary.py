points, arguments, or findings presented.

2. Be concise: Summarize the article in a succinct manner, focusing on the most important information. Avoid 
unnecessary details or excessive elaboration.

3. Maintain accuracy: Ensure that the summary accurately reflects the content and main points of the original 
article. Avoid introducing new ideas or misrepresenting the author's intent.

4. Prioritize relevance: Emphasize the information that is most relevant to the article's main idea. Remove any 
tangential or less significant details.

5. Maintain proper structure: Organize the summary logically, presenting the information in a coherent and cohesive 
manner. Consider using paragraph breaks to separate different ideas or sections."""
